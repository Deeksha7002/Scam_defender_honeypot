# Honeypot AI - Product Demo Storyboard
**Duration**: 60 Seconds
**Goal**: Demonstrate the end-to-end flow of trapping a scammer.

## Scene 1: The Shield (0:00 - 0:10)
**Visual**: ![App Icon](/pwa_icon_shield_1770178519695.png)
**Script**: "This is Honeypot AI. While traditional antivirus software hides you from threats, we take the fight *to* them. It installs directly on your device as a Progressive Web App, sitting silently in the background."

## Scene 2: The Watchtower (0:10 - 0:25)
**Visual**: ![Global Dashboard](/dashboard_attack_mockup_1770174677635.png)
**Script**: "Our Global Surveillance Dashboard monitors threat vectors in real-time. Here, we see a 'Botnet' attack initiating from a high-risk region. Instead of blocking it, we open the gates."

## Scene 3: The Intercept (0:25 - 0:40)
**Visual**: ![Chat Loop](/chat_loop_mockup_1770174640768.png)
**Script**: "The system automatically intercepts the scammer's message. Our AI Agent engages them in an infinite loop, wasting their time with realistic, confusing responses. The scammer thinks they are talking to a victim, but they are talking to a ghost."

## Scene 4: Safety Protocols (0:40 - 0:45)
**Visual**: ![Safety Redaction](/safety_redaction_mockup_1770179307171.png)
**Script**: "This entire time, our Safety Guard is active. It uses Soundscapes to simulate a real environment (typing sounds, alerts) while redacting your personal PII in real-time. Your data never leaves the vault."

## Scene 5: Intelligence Gathering (0:45 - 0:50)
**Visual**: ![Financial Intercept](/financial_intercept_mockup_1770174657995.png)
**Script**: "While they talk, we trace. The system extracts critical financial intelligence—UPI IDs, Crypto Wallets, and IP addresses—building a profile of the attacker."

## Scene 6: Case Closed (0:50 - 1:00)
**Visual**: ![Evidence Locker](/evidence_locker_mockup_1770179033961.png)
**Script**: "Finally, all data is compiled into a forensic evidence report, ready for law enforcement. Honeypot AI: Don't just block scams. Break them."
